## Pubit Frontend

Pubit is a revolutionary Blockchain-Based Licensing Decentralized Application (DApp) that aims to transform the licensing industry by introducing transparency, security, and efficiency. Leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and a decentralized marketplace, Pubit addresses the challenges associated with traditional licensing processes, benefiting creators, businesses, and consumers alike.
The frontend is built using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

-   **Content Discovery**: Users can browse and search for content published on the platform, making it easy to discover new and interesting works.

-   **Secure Wallet Integration**: Pubit supports various Ethereum wallets, allowing users to securely manage their funds and interact with the platform.
